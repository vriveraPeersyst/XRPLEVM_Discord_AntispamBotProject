# XRPL EVM Antispam Bot

The **XRPL EVM Antispam Bot** is designed to help moderate spam in your XRPL EVM Discord community. It detects spam messages based on specific keywords and channel-name matching rules, tracks spam counts persistently across bot restarts, and automatically assigns a restricted role when the spam threshold is exceeded.

---

## Features

- **Spam Detection:**  
  - Flags messages that match defined keywords (e.g. `"hi"`, `"gm"`, `"hello", "xrpl"`).  
  - Detects single-word messages that appear anywhere in the channelâ€™s name (e.g. detecting `"funding"` in a channel named "ðŸ’°ãƒ»funding").

- **Spam Tracking:**  
  - Increments a user's spam count upon every detected spam message.
  - Persists spam counts to `spamCounts.json` so data survives bot restarts.

- **Role Management:**  
  - Automatically assigns a restricted role when a member exceeds 3 spam messages.
  - Ensures the restricted role is only assigned if the user does not already have it.

- **Message Cleanup:**  
  - Deletes spam messages 30 seconds after detection, helping to keep channels clean.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 16 or later (LTS recommended).
- **pnpm:** Install via `npm install -g pnpm`.
- **Discord Bot:**  
  - Create a bot via the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).  
  - Ensure the bot has the **Manage Messages** and **Manage Roles** permissions.  
  - Verify that the botâ€™s role is above the restricted role in your serverâ€™s role hierarchy.

### Clone & Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/xrplevm-antispam-bot.git
   cd xrplevm-antispam-bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install -w
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   - Copy the example file:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - Edit `.env` and set your Discord bot token and restricted role ID:

     ```dotenv
     TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
     RESTRICTED_ROLE_ID=your_restricted_role_id_here
     ```

## Running the Bot

Launch the bot using:

```bash
pnpm run dev:bot
```

The bot logs critical events to the console, such as successful login, spam message detection, spam count increments, role assignments, and deletion of spam messages after a 30-second delay.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:**  
   - The bot loads environment variables and initializes the Discord client using `bot.factory.ts`.
   - When ready, it logs the bot's tag (e.g., "Logged in as XRPLEVM_Antispam_bot#9445!").

2. **Message Monitoring:**  
   - The bot listens for every message (ignoring bot messages and non-guild messages).
   - Each message is passed to `isSpamMessage` in the detector service:
     - The message is normalized (trimmed and converted to lowercase).
     - It checks for exact spam keyword matches.
     - It further checks if a single-word message is included anywhere in the channel's name.

3. **Spam Tracking & Role Assignment:**  
   - For every detected spam message, the bot increments the userâ€™s spam count.
   - Spam counts are persisted in `spamCounts.json`.
   - When a user's spam count reaches 3, the bot assigns the restricted role (using `assignRestrictedRole`) and resets the count.

4. **Message Cleanup:**  
   - Spam messages are scheduled for deletion after 30 seconds, ensuring channels remain clutter-free.
